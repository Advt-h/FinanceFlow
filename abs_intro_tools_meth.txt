FinanceFlow leverages Firebase for secure authentication and real-time data synchronization, while Recharts provides interactive data visualizations. The application’s modular architecture and responsive design ensure that users can manage their finances anytime, anywhere, with confidence and ease.


Key ML Feature:
FinanceFlow integrates simple machine learning and statistical models to forecast monthly expenses by analyzing each user's historical spending data. This proactive approach offers users personalized budget guidance, helping them anticipate future expenses and avoid overspending before it happens. The ML-driven forecast is seamlessly woven into the user experience, making advanced insights accessible to everyone.



FEATURES

1. User Authentication:
Users can create accounts and log in securely using Firebase Authentication, which ensures password protection and account safety. The app also allows users to change their password within the settings, further enhancing account security and giving users control over their credentials.


2. Expense Tracking and Management:

FinanceFlow enables users to quickly record new expenses, modify existing ones, or remove them as needed. All expenses can be organized into user-defined categories, making it easier to track spending patterns and analyze financial habits over time. Users can now select the date for each expense, allowing for accurate backdated entries.
ML Integration: The expense data that users enter forms the foundation for the monthly expense forecast. As users add more expenses, the forecasting model becomes more accurate, ensuring that predictions reflect the most current and comprehensive view of their financial activity.

3. Budgeting:
Users can set and adjust monthly budget targets, helping them stay on track with their financial goals. Real-time updates show how much of the budget has been used, with visual cues for overspending, so users can make informed decisions and avoid exceeding their limits.

4. Data Visualization:
FinanceFlow uses Recharts to display expenses and budget usage by category through interactive charts. This makes it easy for users to spot trends, identify areas of high spending, and gain actionable insights into their financial behavior. The dashboard also features a line chart showing daily spending trends for the current month.


5. Monthly Expense Forecast (Simple ML):

FinanceFlow predicts future monthly spending using simple machine learning and statistical methods. The forecast analyzes your past spending data—using the mean, median, and linear regression—to estimate your expenses for the upcoming month. The model is designed to adapt to the amount of data available, so even users with a short history receive reliable predictions. Forecasts are presented visually on the dashboard, and users receive clear alerts if their predicted spending is likely to exceed their set budget.
ML Details: The forecasting model combines linear regression to identify spending trends, moving average and median calculations to smooth out anomalies, and an ensemble approach to ensure robust predictions. This design allows the model to adapt to small datasets, guaranteeing that every user receives a forecast. Results are communicated both visually and through clear, user-friendly messages, making the insights easy to understand and act upon.

6. Responsive and Accessible Design:
Tailwind CSS provides a consistent, modern dark theme for comfortable viewing, and the interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes. Whether on desktop or mobile, users enjoy a seamless and accessible experience, making it easy to manage finances from anywhere.

7. Settings and Customization:
Users can choose their preferred currency for all financial data, ensuring the app fits their local context. Category management features allow users to add, edit, or delete categories, tailoring the app to their unique budgeting needs and preferences.

8. Security and Privacy:
All sensitive data is securely stored in Firebase and protected by robust authentication mechanisms. This ensures that user information remains private and secure, giving users peace of mind as they manage their finances online.

METHODOLOGY



1. Planning and Requirement Gathering
The initial phase involved identifying core features such as expense tracking, category management, budget setting, user authentication, and monthly expense forecasting. User stories were defined and wireframes were created for the main user flows, including the dashboard, add expense, manage categories, settings, and authentication. Research on best practices for personal finance management applications and simple ML/statistical forecasting was conducted. Feedback from potential users was gathered to refine requirements. Project milestones and a development timeline were established to ensure steady progress and timely delivery.
ML Planning: Special attention was given to the forecasting requirements, with a focus on ensuring that the ML model would remain simple, transparent, and effective regardless of how much data a user had. This approach guarantees that all users benefit from predictive insights, whether they are new to the app or have an extensive financial history.


2. Technology Stack Selection

The technology stack was carefully chosen to support a robust, maintainable, and interactive frontend. React and TypeScript were selected for their ability to create scalable and type-safe user interfaces. Firebase was chosen for secure authentication and real-time cloud data storage. Tailwind CSS enabled rapid UI development, while Vite provided fast builds and hot reloading. Additional libraries such as Recharts for data visualization and React Router for navigation were incorporated. For forecasting, simple ML/statistical methods (linear regression, moving average, median) were implemented in TypeScript. Each technology was evaluated for scalability, security, and ease of integration.
ML Stack: The machine learning logic for forecasting is implemented directly in TypeScript. This decision ensures that the ML component is fully transparent, easy to maintain, and does not rely on any external ML libraries or backend services. As a result, users benefit from fast, reliable predictions that are tightly integrated with the rest of the application.

3. Design and Prototyping
Wireframes and prototypes were developed with a focus on creating a clean, modern, and accessible user interface. Data visualization tools such as charts and tables were used to present financial information clearly. Responsive design principles were applied to ensure usability across devices. High-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes were created to validate user flows and gather feedback. The design was iterated upon based on usability testing and input from stakeholders.


4. Development

During the development phase, authentication, expense, category, budget, and forecasting features were implemented using React components and Firebase services. TypeScript interfaces were used to define data models such as Expense, Category, Budget, and User. Tailwind CSS classes were applied for consistent, dark-themed styling throughout the application. Real-time updates were integrated using Firebase listeners. Modular development practices were followed to ensure code reusability and maintainability, and Git was utilized for version control and collaborative development.
ML Development: The machine learning model for forecasting was rigorously tested with datasets of varying sizes. This ensured that the predictions remained robust and the messaging user-friendly, regardless of how much data a user had entered. The iterative approach allowed for continuous refinement of both the model and its integration into the user interface.


5. Testing and Iteration

Manual testing was performed for all user flows, including adding, editing, and deleting expenses, managing categories, setting budgets, forecasting, and user authentication processes such as login, register, and logout. UI/UX issues were addressed and accessibility was improved based on feedback. Data integrity and security were ensured through Firebase rules and validation. Cross-browser and cross-device testing was conducted to guarantee consistent performance. After launch, user feedback was collected and used to plan future enhancements based on real-world usage.
ML Testing: The forecasting feature underwent thorough validation with both sparse and rich datasets. This process ensured that the model delivered accurate and reliable predictions for all users, regardless of the amount of historical data available.
