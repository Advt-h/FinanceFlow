# How the Monthly Expense Forecast Model Works (Layman Terms)

Our app predicts your future monthly spending using simple, easy-to-understand methods. Here’s how it works:

## 1. If You Have Only 1 Month of Data
- The app uses your total spending from last month as the prediction for next month.
- Example: If you spent $1,000 last month, it predicts you’ll spend $1,000 next month.

## 2. If You Have 2 or 3 Months of Data
- The app calculates the average and the middle value (median) of your last few months.
- It then averages those two numbers for a balanced prediction.
- Example: If you spent $900, $1,000, and $1,200 in the last three months:
  - Average = ($900 + $1,000 + $1,200) / 3 = $1,033
  - Median = $1,000
  - Prediction = ($1,033 + $1,000) / 2 = $1,016.50

## 3. If You Have 4 or More Months of Data
- The app uses three methods and averages them:
  1. **Trend Line (Regression):** Looks for an upward or downward pattern in your spending.
  2. **Moving Average:** Averages your last three months.
  3. **Median:** Finds the middle value of all your months.
- The final prediction is the average of these three numbers.

## Why This Works
- These methods are simple, reliable, and don’t need a lot of data.
- They help smooth out unusual months and give a fair estimate, even if you’re new to tracking expenses.

## What If You Have Very Little Data?
- The app always gives you a prediction, even if you only have one month of spending history.
- As you add more months, the prediction gets smarter and more accurate.

**In short:**
- The app uses your past spending to guess your future spending, using simple math and patterns anyone can understand.
- No complicated AI—just smart, practical forecasting!
