# Project Flow: FinanceFlow

## Overview
FinanceFlow is a personal finance management web application built with React and Firebase. It allows users to track expenses, manage categories, and set monthly budgets. The dashboard visualizes spending and supports user authentication with email verification.

## User Journey
1. **Registration & Login**
   - Users register with email and password.
   - A verification email is sent on registration. Only verified users should be allowed to log in (recommended for future implementation).
   - User data is stored in Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

2. **Categories Management**
   - Users create categories (e.g., Food, Transport) before adding expenses.
   - Categories are stored per user in Firestore.

3. **Adding Expenses**
   - Users can add expenses only if at least one category exists.
   - Each expense is linked to a category and includes amount, date, and optional note/description.
   - Expenses are stored per user in Firestore.

4. **Dashboard**
   - Shows total spending, monthly budget, and a pie chart of expenses by category.
   - Lists recent transactions.
   - If no categories exist, prompts the user to add categories to enable expense tracking.

5. **Budgeting**
   - Users can set a monthly budget.
   - The dashboard shows the percentage of the budget used based on total expenses for the month.

6. **Settings**
   - Users can update their password and manage account settings.

## Data Model
- **User**: { email, createdAt }
- **Category**: { id, name, color }
- **Expense**: { id, date, category, amount, description }
- **Budget**: { month, limit, spent }

## Monthly Expense Forecast (for future implementation)
To implement a monthly expense forecast feature, you can:
- Aggregate user expenses by month and category from historical data in Firestore.
- Calculate average monthly spending for each category and overall.
- Use simple statistical methods (e.g., mean, median, or linear trend) to project total expenses for the current or upcoming month.
- Optionally, factor in recent spending trends (e.g., last 3 months) for more accurate forecasts.
- Display the forecasted total and per-category expenses on the dashboard, alongside the user’s budget and actual spending.
- Alert users if their forecasted expenses are likely to exceed their set budget.

### Example Forecast Flow
1. Fetch all expenses for the user from Firestore.
2. Group expenses by month and category.
3. Calculate average spend per month (overall and per category).
4. Use the average or trend to forecast the current/upcoming month’s expenses.
5. Show the forecast in the dashboard, e.g., “Forecasted spending this month: $X.”
6. Optionally, visualize the forecast vs. budget and actual spending.

This project flow provides the necessary context for integrating a monthly expense forecast feature. All relevant user, category, expense, and budget data is available in Firestore and can be leveraged for analytics and forecasting.
